<p>Imagine you're using Windows (or Linux if the former makes you want to run away), you decide you must try out that new, shiny, free, the best reviewed image editor ever. Eagerly you find the download link, hovering over it in excitement like the nerd you are before pressing it, soon it's on your drive. Wasting no time, you try to install it and....it won't let you. Why? Oh, you didn't hear? Seems Microsoft decided to release its own app store, and you must get all your software from it, sideloading is not allowed. At least not unless you go through a complex process that may require you to do a full reinstall of your <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> if you cock it up. That likely sounds ridiculous, and, of course, it is, and yet that's the reality of the likes of iOS. While Android makes sideloading easy, it's still far more limiting than I'd prefer. So, here I am wasting your time ranting about it.</p>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>Firstly, I'm not opposed to an app store. It's ability to let users easily find and install apps is rather handy. Furthermore, it's far more likely to keep out malware ridden crap than a random place on the Internet, at least if it's even half decent. I'm not even opposed to it being run by the same company making the OS, that said it shouldn't be the only such storefront. Secondly, I'm aware of the relatively recent ability to sideload apps in the EU for iOS. Being Australian, this doesn't apply here, nor does it anywhere else and that's most of the world. Even in Antartica an Iphone has probably been used at least once. With that excuse for a disclaimer out of the way, lets proceed.</p>
