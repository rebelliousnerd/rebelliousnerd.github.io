<p>I could say something like "The LG Prada could've been a contender. Revoulitisoning smartphones and allowing LG to compete alongside the likes of Apple and Google for domainance in the handheld market." But, I wont, because that would be utter bullshit! It does however have a claim to fame that many people attritutue to Apple and no, it's not having invented the smartphone, that one is just too obviously false, though I'd get how kids nowadays might think so. It's claim is more obscure in nature, yet it's something most people use everyday, a capacative touchscreen.</p>
